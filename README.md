# allergy-helper

The idea is to create a web application that helps people with allergies.  
The user can list their allergies.  
The user can take a picture of the back of a product and the application will tell the user if the product contains any of the allergens listed by the user.

## Dev log

```bash
# Well, looks like the performances of tesseract.js are not that great.
# There is no way to make it work in real time or near real time and the quality of the results is not that great.
# Chrome does not have https://chromestatus.com/feature/5644087665360896 text detection by default which is annoying.
# Good try, goodbye.
```
